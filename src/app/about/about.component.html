<p class="text-info">

    Adventure Consultancy solutions is a fintech specialising and focused on the mobilisation, development, orchestration and promotion of an open banking economy.

​

Our core aim as an organisation is to become the world’s number one open banking orchestrator.

 

Instead of building core platforms, our desire is to accentuate customer experience by building on top of existing partner capabilities, with the ambition of managing customer solutions end to end; including hosting, integration, validation and operational management.

 

We help our partners deliver technology initiatives by providing OR building capability through our communities of practice (Engineering, QA, Project Management). 

 

Leverage our talent capability OR let us build this for you, ensuring long term sustainability and scalability wrapped in your culture and environment.

​

Thus demonstrating our core values: Customer, Collaboration, Partnering and Inclusivity -  “We are not a body shop”.
